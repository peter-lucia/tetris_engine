# Tetris
* A tetris game engine backend API built with rust

### Getting started

TBD

### Rust Crate (Binary)

Simulate a game

```bash
cargo run --bin rust_tetris
```

### Rust Crate (Library)

Build the library only

```bash
cargo build --lib rust_tetris
```

### TODO
- [ ] Crate available for rust
- [ ] API interface
- [x] Build pipeline - cross-compile for mac, windows, linux
